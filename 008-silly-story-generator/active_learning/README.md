# Silly story generator

In this assessment you'll be tasked with taking some of the knowledge you've 
picked up in this module's articles and applying it to creating a fun app that 
generates random silly stories. Have fun!

## Project brief

You have been provided with some raw HTML/CSS and a few text strings and JavaScript functions; 
you need to write the necessary JavaScript to turn this into a working program, which does the 
following:

- Generates a silly story when the 'Generate random story' button is pressed.
- Replaces the default name 'Bob' in the story with a custom name, only if a 
custom name is entered into the 'Enter custom name' text field before the 
generate button is pressed.
- Converts the default US weight and temperature quantities and units in the 
story into UK equivalents if the UK radio button is checked before the 
generate button is pressed.
- Generates a new random silly story every time the button is pressed.
