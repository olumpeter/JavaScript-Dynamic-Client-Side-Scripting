    # Introducing asynchronous JavaScript

    Asynchronous programming is a technique that enables your program to start a 
    potentially long-running task and still be able to be responsive to other 
    events while that task runs, rather than having to wait until that task has 
    finished. Once that task has finished, your program is presented with the result.
    
    Many functions provided by browsers, especially the most interesting ones, can 
    potentially take a long time, and therefore, are asynchronous. For example:

      - Making HTTP requests using `fetch()`
      - Accessing a user's camera or microphone using `getUserMedia()`
      - Asking a user to select files using `showOpenFilePicker()`

    So even though you may not have to implement your own asynchronous functions 
    very often, you are very likely to need to use them correctly.

    In this article, we'll start by looking at the problem with long-running 
    synchronous functions, which make asynchronous programming a necessity.

    ## Synchronous programming

    Consider the following code:

    ```js
    const name = 'Miriam';
    const greeting = `Hello, my name is ${name}!`;
    console.log(greeting);
    // 'Hello, my name is Miriam!'    
    ```

    Here, `makeGreeting()` is a synchronous function because the caller has to 
    wait for the function to finish its work and return a value before the caller 
    can continue.

    ## A long-running synchronous function

    What if the synchronous function takes a long time?

    The program below uses a very inefficient algorithm to generate multiple large 
    prime numbers when a user clicks the 'Generate primes' button. The higher the 
    number of primes a user specifies, the longer the operation will take.

    Try clicking 'Generate primes'. Depending on how fast your computer is, it 
    will probably take a few seconds before the program displays the 'Finished!' 
    message.

    ## The trouble with long-running synchronous functions

    The next example is just like the last one, except we added a text box for 
    you to type in. This time, click 'Generate primes', and try typing in the 
    text box immediately after.

    You'll find that while our `generatePrimes()` function is running, our program 
    is completely unresponsive: you can't type anything, click anything, or do 
    anything else.

    The reason for this is that this JavaScript program is `single-threaded`. A 
    thread is a sequence of instructions that a program follows. Because the 
    program consists of a single thread, it can only do one thing at a time: so 
    if it is waiting for our long-running synchronous call to return, it can't do 
    anything else.

    What we need is a way for our program to:

      1. Start a long-running operation by calling a function.
      1. Have that function start the operation and return immediately, so that 
      our program can still be responsive to other events.
      1. Have the function execute the operation in a way that does not block the 
      1. main thread, for example by starting a new thread.
      1. Notify us with the result of the operation when it eventually completes.

    That's precisely what asynchronous functions enable us to do. The rest of this 
    module explains how they are implemented in JavaScript.

    ## Event handlers

    Event handlers are really a form of asynchronous programming: you provide a 
    function (the event handler) that will be called, not right away, but 
    whenever the event happens. If 'the event' is 'the asynchronous operation has 
    completed', then that event could be used to notify the caller about the 
    result of an asynchronous function call.

    Some early asynchronous APIs used events in just this way. The 
    `XMLHttpRequest` API enables you to make HTTP requests to a remote server 
    using JavaScript. Since this can take a long time, it's an asynchronous API, 
    and you get notified about the progress and eventual completion of a request 
    by attaching event listeners to the `XMLHttpRequest` object.

    The following example shows this in action. Press 'Click to start request' to 
    send a request. We create a new XMLHttpRequest and listen for its loadend event. 
    The handler logs a 'Finished!' message along with the status code.

    This is just like the event handlers we've encountered in a previous module, 
    except that instead of the event being a user action, such as the user clicking 
    a button, the event is a change in the state of some object.

    ## Callbacks

    An event handler is a particular type of callback. A callback is just a 
    function that's passed into another function, with the expectation that the 
    callback will be called at the appropriate time. As we just saw, callbacks 
    used to be the main way asynchronous functions were implemented in JavaScript.

    However, callback-based code can get hard to understand when the callback 
    itself has to call functions that accept a callback. This is a common 
    situation if you need to perform some operation that breaks down into a 
    series of asynchronous functions. For example, consider the following:
