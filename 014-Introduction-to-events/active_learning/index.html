    # Introduction to events

    Events are things that happen in the system you are programming, which the 
    system tells you about so your code can react to them.

    For example, if the user clicks a button on a webpage, you might want to 
    react to that action by displaying an information box. In this article, we 
    discuss some important concepts surrounding events, and look at how they work 
    in browsers. This won't be an exhaustive study; just what you need to know at 
    this stage.

    ## What is an event?

    Events are things that happen in the system you are programming — the 
    system produces (or &quot;fires&quot;) a signal of some kind when an event 
    occurs, and provides a mechanism by which an action can be automatically 
    taken (that is, some code running) when the event occurs. Events are fired 
    inside the browser window, and tend to be attached to a specific item that 
    resides in it. This might be a single element, a set of elements, the HTML 
    document loaded in the current tab, or the entire browser window. There are 
    many different types of events that can occur.

    For example:

      - The user selects, clicks, or hovers the cursor over a certain element.
      - The user chooses a key on the keyboard.
      - The user resizes or closes the browser window.
      - A web page finishes loading.
      - A form is submitted.
      - A video is played, paused, or ends. An error occurs.

    You can gather from this (and from glancing at the [MDN event reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events)) that 
    there are **a lot** of events that can be fired.

    To react to an event, you attach an event handler to it. This is a block of 
    code (usually a JavaScript function that you as a programmer create) that runs 
    when the event fires. When such a block of code is defined to run in response 
    to an event, we say we are registering an event handler. Note: Event handlers 
    are sometimes called event listeners — they are pretty much interchangeable 
    for our purposes, although strictly speaking, they work together. The listener 
    listens out for the event happening, and the handler is the code that is run 
    in response to it happening.

    >**Note**: Web events are not part of the core JavaScript language — they are 
    defined as part of the APIs built into the browser.

    ## An example: handling a click event

    See in code

    ## Using addEventListener()

    As we saw in the last example, objects that can fire events have an 
    addEventListener() method, and this is the recommended mechanism for adding 
    event handlers.

    ```js
    const btn = document.querySelector('button');

    function random(number) {
      return Math.floor(Math.random() * (number + 1));
    }

    btn.addEventListener('click', () => {
      const rndCol = `rgb(${random(255)} ${random(255)} ${random(255)})`;
      document.body.style.backgroundColor = rndCol;
    });
    ```

    It is fine to make the handler function a separate named function, like this:

    ```js
    const btn = document.querySelector('button');

    function random(number) {
      return Math.floor(Math.random() * (number + 1));
    }
    
    function changeBackground() {
      const rndCol = `rgb(${random(255)} ${random(255)} ${random(255)})`;
      document.body.style.backgroundColor = rndCol;
    }
    
    btn.addEventListener('click', changeBackground);
    ```
    
    ### Listening for other events

    There are many different events that can be fired by a button element. Let's 
    experiment.

      - `focus` and `blur` — The color changes when the button is focused and 
      unfocused; try pressing the tab to focus on the button and press the tab 
      again to focus away from the button. These are often used to display 
      information about filling in form fields when they are focused, or to 
      display an error message if a form field is filled with an incorrect value.
      - `dblclick` — The color changes only when the button is double-clicked.
      - `mouseover` and `mouseout` — The color changes when the mouse pointer 
      hovers over the button, or when the pointer moves off the button, 
      respectively.

    Some events, such as click, are available on nearly any element. Others are 
    more specific and only useful in certain situations: for example, the play 
    event is only available on some elements, such as &lt;video&gt;.

    ### Removing listeners

    If you've added an event handler using `addEventListener()`, you can remove 
    it again using the `removeEventListener()` method. For example, this would 
    remove the `changeBackground()` event handler:

    ```js
    btn.removeEventListener('click', changeBackground);
    ```

    Event handlers can also be removed by passing an `AbortSignal` to 
    `addEventListener()` and then later calling `abort()` on the controller 
    owning the `AbortSignal`. For example, to add an event handler that we can 
    remove with an `AbortSignal`:

    ```js
    const controller = new AbortController();

    btn.addEventListener('click',
      () => {
        const rndCol = `rgb(${random(255)} ${random(255)} ${random(255)})`;
        document.body.style.backgroundColor = rndCol;
      },
      { signal: controller.signal } // pass an AbortSignal to this handler
    );
    ```

    Then the event handler created by the code above can be removed like this:

    ```js
    controller.abort(); // removes any/all event handlers associated with this controller
    ```

    For simple, small programs, cleaning up old, unused event handlers isn't 
    necessary, but for larger, more complex programs, it can improve efficiency. 
    Also, the ability to remove event handlers allows you to have the same button 
    performing different actions in different circumstances: all you have to do 
    is add or remove handlers.

    ### Adding multiple listeners for a single event

    By making more than one call to `addEventListener()`, providing different 
    handlers, you can have multiple handlers for a single event:

    ```js
    myElement.addEventListener('click', functionA);
    myElement.addEventListener('click', functionB);
    ```

    Both functions would now run when the element is clicked.

    ### Learn more

    There are other powerful features and options available with `addEventListener()`.

    These are a little out of scope for this article, but if you want to read them, 
    visit the `addEventListener()` and `removeEventListener()` reference pages.

    ## Other event listener mechanisms

    We recommend that you use `addEventListener()` to register event handlers. 
    It's the most powerful method and scales best with more complex programs. 
    However, there are two other ways of registering event handlers that you 
    might see: *event handler properties* and *inline event handlers*.

    ### Event handler properties

    Objects (such as buttons) that can fire events also usually have properties 
    whose name is `on` followed by the name of the event. For example, elements 
    have a property `onclick`. This is called an *event handler property*. To 
    listen for the event, you can assign the handler function to the property.

    For example, we could rewrite the random-color example like this:

    ```js
    const btn = document.querySelector('button');

    function random(number) {
      return Math.floor(Math.random() * (number + 1));
    }
    
    btn.onclick = () => {
      const rndCol = `rgb(${random(255)} ${random(255)} ${random(255)})`;
      document.body.style.backgroundColor = rndCol;
    };
    ```

    You can also set the handler property to a named function:

    ```js
    const btn = document.querySelector('button');

    function random(number) {
      return Math.floor(Math.random() * (number + 1));
    }

    function bgChange() {
      const rndCol = `rgb(${random(255)} ${random(255)} ${random(255)})`;
      document.body.style.backgroundColor = rndCol;
    }

    btn.onclick = bgChange;
    ```

    With event handler properties, you can't add more than one handler for a 
    single event. For example, you can call `addEventListener('click', handler)` 
    on an element multiple times, with different functions specified in the 
    second argument:

    ```js
    element.addEventListener('click', function1);
    element.addEventListener('click', function2);
    ```

    This is impossible with event handler properties because any subsequent 
    attempts to set the property will overwrite earlier ones:

    ```js
    element.onclick = function1;
    element.onclick = function2;
    ```

    ## Inline event handlers — don't use these

    You might also see a pattern like this in your code:

    ```html
    &lt;button onclick=&quot;bgChange()&quot;&gt;Press me&lt;/button&gt;
    ```

    ```js
    function bgChange() {
      const rndCol = `rgb(${random(255)} ${random(255)} ${random(255)})`;
      document.body.style.backgroundColor = rndCol;
    }
    ```

    The earliest method of registering event handlers found on the Web involved 
    event handler HTML attributes (or inline event handlers) like the one shown 
    above — the attribute value is literally the JavaScript code you want to run 
    when the event occurs. The above example invokes a function defined inside a 
    &lt;script&gt; element on the same page, but you could also insert JavaScript 
    directly inside the attribute, for example:

    ```html
    &lt;button onclick=&quot;alert('Hello, this is my old-fashioned event handler!');&quot;&gt;
      Press me
    &lt;/button&gt;
    ```

    You can find HTML attribute equivalents for many of the event handler 
    properties; however, you shouldn't use these — they are considered bad 
    practice. It might seem easy to use an event handler attribute if you are 
    doing something really quick, but they quickly become unmanageable and 
    inefficient.

    For a start, it is not a good idea to mix up your HTML and your JavaScript, 
    as it becomes hard to read. Keeping your JavaScript separate is a good 
    practice, and if it is in a separate file you can apply it to multiple HTML 
    documents.

    Even in a single file, inline event handlers are not a good idea. One button 
    is OK, but what if you had 100 buttons? You'd have to add 100 attributes to 
    the file; it would quickly turn into a maintenance nightmare. With JavaScript, 
    you could easily add an event handler function to all the buttons on the page 
    no matter how many there were, using something like this:

    ```js
    const buttons = document.querySelectorAll('button');

    for (const button of buttons) {
      button.addEventListener('click', bgChange);
    }
    ```

    Finally, many common server configurations will disallow inline JavaScript, 
    as a security measure.

    *You should never use the HTML event handler attributes* — those are outdated, 
    and using them is bad practice.

    ## Event objects

    Sometimes, inside an event handler function, you'll see a parameter specified 
    with a name such as event, evt, or e. This is called the event object, and 
    it is automatically passed to event handlers to provide extra features and 
    information. For example, let's rewrite our random color example again 
    slightly:

    ```js
    const btn = document.querySelector('button');

    function random(number) {
      return Math.floor(Math.random() * (number + 1));
    }
    
    function bgChange(e) {
      const rndCol = `rgb(${random(255)} ${random(255)} ${random(255)})`;
      e.target.style.backgroundColor = rndCol;
      console.log(e);
    }
    
    btn.addEventListener('click', bgChange);
    ```

    Here you can see we are including an event object, **e**, in the function, 
    and in the function setting a background color style on `e.target` — which is 
    the button itself. The target property of the event object is always a 
    reference to the element the event occurred upon. So, in this example, we are 
    setting a random background color on the button, not the page.

    >**Note**: See the **Event delegation** section below for an example where we 
    use `event.target`.

    >**Note:** You can use any name you like for the event object — you just need 
    to choose a name that you can then use to reference it inside the event handler 
    function. `e`/`evt`/`event` is most commonly used by developers because they 
    are short and easy to remember. It's always good to be consistent — with 
    yourself, and with others if possible.

    ## Extra properties of event objects

    Most event objects have a standard set of properties and methods available on 
    the event object; see the [Event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event) 
    object reference for a full list.

    Some event objects add extra properties that are relevant to that particular 
    type of event. For example, the `keydown` event fires when the user presses a 
    key. Its event object is a `KeyboardEvent`, which is a specialized Event object 
    with a key property that tells you which key was pressed:

    ## Preventing default behavior

    Sometimes, you'll come across a situation where you want to prevent an event 
    from doing what it does by default. The most common example is that of a web 
    form, for example, a custom registration form. When you fill in the details 
    and click the submit button, the natural behavior is for the data to be 
    submitted to a specified page on the server for processing, and the browser 
    to be redirected to a &quot;success message&quot; page of some kind (or the 
    same page, if another is not specified).
    
    The trouble comes when the user has not submitted the data correctly — as a 
    developer, you want to prevent the submission to the server and give an error 
    message saying what's wrong and what needs to be done to put things right. Some 
    browsers support automatic form data validation features, but since many don't, 
    you are advised to not rely on those and implement your own validation checks. 
    Let's look at a simple example.

    ## Event bubbling

    Event bubbling describes how the browser handles events targeted at nested 
    elements.

    ### Setting a listener on a parent element

    Here the button is inside another element, a `&lt;div&gt;` element. We say 
    that the `&lt;div&gt;` element here is the parent of the element it contains. 
    What happens if we add a click event handler to the parent, then click the 
    button?

    You'll see that the parent fires a click event when the user clicks the button:

    ```
    You clicked on a DIV element
    ```

    This makes sense: the button is inside the `&lt;div&gt;`, so when you click 
    the button you're also implicitly clicking the element it is inside.

    ### Bubbling example

    What happens if we add event listeners to the button and the parent?

    You'll see that all four elements fire a click event when the user clicks the button:

    In this case:

      - the click on the button fires first
      - followed by the click on its parent (the `&lt;div&gt;` element)
      - followed by the `&lt;div&gt;` element's parent (the `&lt;body&gt;` element).
    
    We describe this by saying that the event **bubbles up** from the innermost 
    element that was clicked.
    
    ### Fixing the problem with stopPropagation()

    Event bubbling can sometimes create problems, but there is a way to prevent it.
    The Event object has a function available on it called `stopPropagation()` which, \
    when called inside an event handler, prevents the event from bubbling up to 
    any other elements. 

    ### Event capture

    An alternative form of event propagation is *event capture*. This is like 
    event bubbling but the order is reversed: so instead of the event firing 
    first on the innermost element targeted, and then on successively less nested 
    elements, the event fires first on the least nested element, and then on 
    successively more nested elements, until the target is reached.

    Event capture is disabled by default. To enable it you have to pass the 
    `capture` option in `addEventListener()`.

    ## Event delegation

    Event bubbling isn't just annoying, though: it can be very useful. In 
    particular, it enables event delegation. In this practice, when we want some 
    code to run when the user interacts with any one of a large number of child 
    elements, we set the event listener on their parent and have events that 
    happen on them bubble up to their parent rather than having to set the event 
    listener on every child individually.

    ## It's not just web pages

    Events are not unique to JavaScript — most programming languages have some 
    kind of event model, and the way the model works often differs from 
    JavaScript's way. In fact, the event model in JavaScript for web pages 
    differs from the event model for JavaScript as it is used in other 
    environments.

    For example, [Node.js](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs) 
    is a very popular JavaScript runtime that enables developers to use JavaScript 
    to build network and server-side applications. The [Node.js event model](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html) 
    relies on listeners to listen for events and emitters to emit events periodically 
    — it doesn't sound that different, but the code is quite different, making use 
    of functions like `on()` to register an event listener, and `once()` to 
    register an event listener that unregisters after it has run once. The HTTP 
    connect event docs provide a good example.

    You can also use JavaScript to build cross-browser add-ons — browser 
    functionality enhancements — using a technology called WebExtensions. The 
    event model is similar to the web events model, but a bit different — event 
    listeners' properties are written in camel case (such as onMessage rather than 
    onmessage), and need to be combined with the addListener function. See the 
    runtime.onMessage page for an example.

    You don't need to understand anything about other such environments at this 
    stage in your learning; we just wanted to make it clear that events can differ 
    in different programming environments.

    ## Test your skills: Events

    ### Task 1

    In our first events-related task, you need to create a simple event handler 
    that causes the text inside the button to change when it is clicked on, and 
    change back when it is clicked again.

    The HTML should not be changed; just the JavaScript.

    The finished code should look something like this:

    ```js
    const btn = document.querySelector('button');

    btn.addEventListener('click', () => {
      if (btn.className === 'on') {
        btn.textContent = 'Machine is off';
        btn.className = 'off';
      } else {
        btn.textContent = 'Machine is on';
        btn.className = 'on';
      }
    });
    ```

    ### Task 2

    Our final events-related task involves making use of bubbling and event 
    objects. You need to set a click listener on the buttons' parent element, 
    which when invoked by clicking any of the buttons will use `e.target` to grab 
    the data-color attribute of the particular button that was clicked, and set 
    the background of the button-bar to that color.

    You should be able to solve this without looping through all the buttons and 
    giving each one their own event listener.

    The code should look like this:

    ```js
    const buttonBar = document.querySelector('.button-bar');

    // Add your code here
  
    function setColor(e) {
      buttonBar.style.backgroundColor = e.target.getAttribute('data-color');
    }
    
    buttonBar.addEventListener('click', setColor);
    ```

    ## Conclusion

    You should now know all you need to know about web events at this early stage. 
    As mentioned, events are not really part of the core JavaScript — they are 
    defined in browser Web APIs.

    Also, it is important to understand that the different contexts in which 
    JavaScript is used have different event models — from Web APIs to other areas 
    such as browser WebExtensions and Node.js (server-side JavaScript). We are not 
    expecting you to understand all of these areas now, but it certainly helps to 
    understand the basics of events as you forge ahead with learning web development.
